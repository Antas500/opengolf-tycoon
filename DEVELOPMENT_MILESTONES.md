**STATUS: COMPLETE** - Full group spawning with dynamic tee-time management:
- ✅ Spawn golfers in groups of 1-4 players randomly when game starts
- ✅ Dynamic spawning based on first tee availability (new group spawns when tee is clear)
- ✅ Minimum 10-second cooldown between group spawns

- ✅ Deadlock prevention: only groups ahead (lower group_id) can block, preventing circular waits
- ✅ Reputation gain when golfers finish rounds
- ⏳ Start golfers near clubhouse (currently spawn at tee box)
- ⏳ Course fun rating should bias for more foursomes

### [X] Complete Golfer Shot System
**STATUS: COMPLETE** - Full club-based shot mechanics with terrain modifiers:
- ✅ **Driver**: Long distance (200-300 yards), 70% base accuracy, driving skill primary
- ✅ **Iron**: Medium distance (100-200 yards), 85% base accuracy, accuracy skill primary
- ✅ **Wedge**: Short distance (20-100 yards), 95% base accuracy, great from sand
- ✅ **Putter**: Green only (0-40 yards), 98% base accuracy, putting skill based
- ✅ Club selection AI based on distance and terrain
- ✅ Shot calculations use appropriate skill stats per club type
- ✅ Lie type affects accuracy (rough: -25%, bunker: -40-60%, trees: -70%)
- ✅ Terrain affects distance (rough: -15%, bunker: -25%, trees: -40%)
- ✅ Short game accuracy boost: distance-based floor for wedge shots matches real amateur averages (20yds ~7yd error, 100yds ~20yd error)
- ✅ Putt accuracy floor: short putts 95% minimum, long putts 75% minimum (prevents wildly missed short putts)
- ✅ Double par pickup rule: golfers pick up after 2x par strokes to prevent infinite loops
- ✅ Wind effects on ball flight (implemented in P3)
- ✅ **Angular dispersion shot model**: Replaces uniform random error with realistic bell-curve (gaussian) angular dispersion. Shots rotate by miss angle sampled from normal distribution, so most shots land near target line with occasional big hooks/slices in the tails
- ✅ **Miss tendency per golfer**: Each golfer has persistent `miss_tendency` (-1.0 to +1.0) for slice/hook bias. Beginners have strong tendencies (±0.4-0.8), pros are nearly neutral (±0.0-0.15). Generated in `GolferTier.generate_skills()`
- ✅ **Shank mechanic**: Rare catastrophic miss (35-55° off-line, 30-60% distance) with probability `(1.0 - accuracy) * 6%`. Only on full swings, direction follows miss_tendency
- ✅ **Gaussian distance loss**: Topped/fat shots use bell curve distribution for distance loss, so most shots are near full distance with occasional chunks

  └── Menu & UI Overhaul           (main menu needed for theme selection; UI theme
  │                                  needed for all new panels in later phases)
  └── depends on: nothing, but all later UI-heavy features benefit from this

Phase 3: Progression & Economy Systems
  ├── Land Purchase & Course Size Progression  (depends on: theme for land pricing)
  ├── Staff & Grounds Maintenance System       (depends on: UI for staff panel)
  └── Marketing & Advertising System           (depends on: UI for marketing panel)

Phase 4: Time & Events
  └── Seasonal Calendar & Event System  (depends on: theme for seasonal modifiers,
                                          staff for seasonal maintenance costs,
                                          marketing for seasonal campaigns)

Phase 5: Major Gameplay & Art
  ├── Player-Controlled Golfer Mode       (largely independent, but benefits from

```

### Phase 1 — Bug Fixes & Visual Polish (2 features) ✅ COMPLETE

**Why first:** These are self-contained improvements with no dependencies. Fixing Z-ordering eliminates a visual bug that would compound as more features add on-screen entities. Elevation contours improve the existing build-mode experience immediately.

| # | Feature | Scope | Key Files | Status |
|---|---------|-------|-----------|--------|
| 1 | Fix Golfer Overlap / Z-Ordering | Small-Medium | `golfer_manager.gd`, `golfer.gd` | ✅ Complete |
| 2 | Improved Elevation Contour Visuals | Medium | `elevation_overlay.gd` | ✅ Complete |

**Completed Deliverables:**
- ✅ Isometric Y-sort on golfer parent node
- ✅ Positional offsets for co-located golfers (tee box fan-out, green semicircle)
- ✅ Name label collision avoidance
- ✅ Active golfer highlight ring
- ✅ Gradient elevation shading with hillshade effect
- ✅ Cached overlay texture (regenerate only on elevation change)

---

### Phase 2 — Theming & UI Infrastructure (2 features) ✅ COMPLETE

**Why second:** The theme system is the single most foundational feature in Priority 10 — sprites, land pricing, seasonal modifiers, and natural object distribution all depend on it. The UI overhaul provides the main menu (needed for theme selection) and establishes the visual language for every panel added in later phases.

| # | Feature | Scope | Key Files | Status |
|---|---------|-------|-----------|--------|
| 3 | Course Type / Theme System | Large | `CourseTheme`, `tileset_generator.gd`, overlays, `game_manager.gd` | ✅ Complete |
| 4 | Menu & UI Overhaul | Large | `main_menu.gd`, `save_load_panel.gd`, UI panels | ✅ Partial (core complete) |

**Completed Deliverables:**
- ✅ `CourseTheme` enum/resource with 6 themes (Parkland, Desert, Links, Mountain, City, Resort)
- ✅ Per-theme color palettes fed into `TilesetGenerator` via `set_theme_colors()`
- ✅ Per-theme overlay tinting (water shimmer, grass blades use theme colors)
- ✅ Per-theme gameplay modifiers (wind, distance, maintenance costs, green fee baseline)
- ✅ Theme selection screen (6 cards with preview, name, description, gameplay hints)
- ✅ Theme stored in `GameManager.current_theme` and serialized in saves
- ✅ Procedural natural object scattering on new-game start via `NaturalTerrainGenerator`
- ✅ Main menu with New Game (theme selection) / Load / Quit
- ✅ Quit to Menu button in Save/Load panel for returning to main menu
- ✅ Theme colors apply correctly on new game (tileset regenerated after theme set)
- ✅ Theme persists through save/load (theme_changed signal emitted on load)
- ✅ Water overlay uses theme-derived shimmer/highlight colors
- ✅ Grass blade overlay uses theme-aware terrain colors
- ✅ Terrain shader parameters use theme colors

**Remaining (deferred to future work):**
- Custom Godot `Theme` resource (buttons, panels, labels, scrollbars)
- Redesigned top bar with segmented sections and icons
- Tabbed toolbar with icon grid and tooltips
- Settings menu (graphics, gameplay, controls)
- Toast notification system

---

### Phase 3 — Progression & Economy Systems (3 features)

**Why third:** These add management depth and spending decisions, which are the core tycoon loop. They all require UI panels (benefiting from the Phase 2 UI overhaul) and interact with the theme system for cost balancing.

| # | Feature | Scope | Key Files |
|---|---------|-------|-----------|
| 5 | Land Purchase & Course Size Progression | Medium-Large | `terrain_grid.gd`, `game_manager.gd`, new land panel UI |
| 6 | Staff & Grounds Maintenance System | Medium-Large | New `staff_manager.gd`, `terrain_grid.gd` (condition tracking), staff panel UI |
| 7 | Marketing & Advertising System | Medium | New `marketing_manager.gd`, `golfer_manager.gd` (spawn modifiers), marketing panel UI |

**These three can be developed in parallel** since they have minimal inter-dependencies. Suggested priority order if done sequentially: Land → Staff → Marketing (land affects buildable area which is most fundamental; staff adds a persistent management layer; marketing is the most self-contained).

**Deliverables:**
- 40x40 starting plot with parcel grid overlay
- Purchasable adjacent parcels with progressive pricing
- Dark tint on unowned land, highlight on purchasable parcels
- Boundary enforcement on all build tools
- Land ownership serialized in saves
- 4 staff types (Groundskeeper, Marshal, Cart Operator, Pro Shop)
- Hire/fire UI with skill levels and salaries
- Per-tile course condition tracking with daily degradation/restoration
- Condition affects gameplay (green speed, fairway lies)
- Payroll as separate line item in financials
- 5 marketing channels with duration, cost, and effect
- Campaign management UI with ROI tracking
- Spawn rate modifiers from active campaigns
- Diminishing returns on stacked campaigns

---

### Phase 4 — Time & Events (1 feature)

**Why fourth:** Seasons affect weather tables, spawn rates, maintenance costs, and marketing effectiveness — all systems that should already exist before layering seasonal variation on top.

| # | Feature | Scope | Key Files |
|---|---------|-------|-----------|
| 8 | Seasonal Calendar & Event System | Medium | `game_manager.gd`, `weather_system.gd`, `golfer_manager.gd`, calendar UI |

**Deliverables:**
- 360-day year with 4 seasons (Spring/Summer/Fall/Winter)
- Per-season weather probability tables
- Per-season spawn rate and maintenance cost multipliers
- Green fee tolerance varies by season
- Calendar UI widget showing current month/season
- Holiday bonus traffic events with advance notice
- Theme-aware seasonal modifiers (Desert/Resort less affected by winter)

---

### Phase 5 — Major Gameplay & Art (2 features)

**Why last:** These are the largest individual features and benefit from every prior system being in place. Player-controlled golf needs the UI overhaul for its HUD. Sprite upgrades need the theme system to know which variants to create. Neither blocks other features, so deferring them reduces risk to the earlier phases.

| # | Feature | Scope | Key Files |
|---|---------|-------|-----------|
| 9 | Player-Controlled Golfer Mode | Very Large | New `player_golfer.gd` or mode in `golfer.gd`, new golf HUD, `ball.gd`, `camera` |
| 10 | Improved Golfer & Natural Object Sprites | Very Large (art-heavy) | `golfer.gd` (render pipeline), all overlay classes, new `assets/sprites/` directory |

**Player-Controlled Golfer can be split into two sub-phases:**
- **Phase 5a — Core shot mechanics:** Club selection bar, click-drag aim with landing zone preview, power meter, shot execution reusing existing ball physics. Scorecard UI.
- **Phase 5b — Full experience:** Putting interface with slope grid, course flyover, player customization, AI playing partners.

**Sprite upgrades can be split into two sub-phases:**
- **Phase 5a — Golfer sprites:** Replace `Polygon2D` rendering with `AnimatedSprite2D` + sprite sheets. 4-direction walk/swing/putt animations.
- **Phase 5b — Environment sprites:** Per-theme tree, rock, and building sprite sets.

---

### Risk Factors & Recommendations

1. **Theme system is the critical path.** It touches the most files (tileset generator + 14 overlays + game manager + save system). Prototype one theme (Desert) end-to-end before building all six.

2. **UI overhaul has high surface area.** Refactoring every panel is time-consuming. Consider doing it incrementally: main menu + theme resource first, then migrate existing panels one at a time rather than a big-bang rewrite.

3. **Player-controlled golfer is the highest-risk feature.** It introduces a fundamentally different input mode and requires a new camera system, shot UI, and game-time management. Build the simplest possible prototype (aim + shoot with existing physics) before investing in the full experience.

4. **Sprite art is a bottleneck.** If hand-drawn sprites aren't feasible, the "Enhanced Procedural" fallback (better shading/outlines on existing `Polygon2D` rendering) ships faster and still improves visual quality meaningfully.

5. **Test coverage matters.** The existing GUT tests cover core systems. Each phase should add tests for new managers (StaffManager, MarketingManager) and data structures (CourseTheme, LandParcel) to prevent regressions.

### Summary

| Phase | Features | Estimated Complexity | Status |
|-------|----------|---------------------|--------|
| 1 | Z-Ordering Fix + Elevation Contours | Small-Medium | ✅ Complete |
| 2 | Theme System + UI Overhaul | Large | ✅ Complete |
| 3 | Land Purchase + Staff + Marketing | Large (parallelizable) | Pending |
| 4 | Seasonal Calendar & Events | Medium | Pending |
| 5 | Player Golf Mode + Sprite Upgrade | Very Large | Pending |

**Total: 10 features across 5 phases. Phases 1-2 complete, 3-5 remaining.**

## PRIORITY 10: Course Theming, Visuals & Gameplay Expansion

### [X] Course Type / Theme System
**STATUS: COMPLETE** - Full course theming system with 6 distinct themes:

**Course Types Implemented:**
- ✅ **Parkland (Default)** - Classic green grass, deciduous trees, gentle rolling hills, flower beds
- ✅ **Desert** - Sandy tan base, cacti, rocky outcroppings, oasis-green fairways, terracotta accents
- ✅ **Links (Oceanfront)** - Golden-brown fescue rough, muted greens, grey-blue water, strong wind
- ✅ **Mountain** - Deep alpine greens, grey stone, pine forests, +5% shot distance (thinner air)
- ✅ **City/Municipal** - Muted urban greens, grey tones, lower maintenance costs
- ✅ **Resort** - Vibrant tropical greens, turquoise water, white sand bunkers, premium pricing

**Implementation Completed:**
- ✅ `CourseTheme` static class (`scripts/systems/course_theme.gd`) with:
  - `get_terrain_colors()` — per-theme color palettes for all terrain types
  - `get_gameplay_modifiers()` — wind_base_strength, distance_modifier, maintenance_cost_multiplier, green_fee_baseline
  - `get_accent_color()`, `get_description()`, `get_theme_name()` — UI display helpers
  - `to_string()` / `from_string()` — serialization for save/load
- ✅ `TilesetGenerator.set_theme_colors()` accepts theme palette, regenerates tileset
- ✅ Theme-aware overlays:
  - `WaterOverlay` — shimmer/highlight colors derived from theme water color
  - `GrassOverlay` — blade colors from `TilesetGenerator.get_color()` for each terrain type
  - `TerrainGrid._apply_variation_shader()` — shader params use theme colors
- ✅ Main menu theme selection (`scripts/ui/main_menu.gd`):
  - 6-card grid showing theme name, description, gameplay modifier hints
  - Click to select, visual highlight on selected card
  - Course name input field
- ✅ Theme stored in `GameManager.current_theme` and serialized in saves
- ✅ `EventBus.theme_changed` signal emitted on new game and load
- ✅ `terrain_grid.regenerate_tileset()` called after theme is set
- ✅ Natural object auto-distribution via `NaturalTerrainGenerator` on new game start
- ✅ Quit to Menu functionality for returning from gameplay to main menu

**Future Extension (not this priority):**
- Multi-course ownership: player can start a second course of a different type
- Unlockable course types based on reputation milestones
- Per-theme tree/rock sprite variants

---

### [] Improved Elevation Contour Visuals
**Goal:** Make elevation contours look more natural and appealing rather than the current hard-edged topographic lines.

**Current State:** `ElevationOverlay` in `scripts/terrain/overlays/elevation_overlay.gd` draws contour lines at elevation boundaries with alpha 0.15-0.2. The lines are drawn per-tile where adjacent tiles have different elevation, producing a jagged staircase effect.

**Improvements:**
- **Smooth contour interpolation:** Instead of drawing hard lines at tile boundaries, use marching squares or a similar algorithm to interpolate contour positions within the tile grid, producing smooth curved contour lines
- **Gradient shading between contours:** Replace the flat alpha tinting with smooth gradient transitions. Tiles should blend gradually between elevation levels rather than having uniform tint per tile
- **Variable line weight:** Contour lines at major elevation intervals (every 2-3 levels) should be thicker/more prominent; intermediate lines should be thin and subtle
- **Natural color grading:** Higher elevations should shift subtly toward lighter/cooler tones; lower elevations toward darker/warmer tones, mimicking real topographic relief shading
- **Hillshade effect:** Add optional directional shading to simulate sunlight hitting slopes (northwest light source convention), giving the terrain a 3D feel without actual 3D rendering
- **Green contour awareness:** Greens should show subtle slope indicators (arrows or grain lines) to help players read putt breaks visually

**Technical Approach:**
- Refactor `ElevationOverlay._draw_elevation_visuals()` to pre-compute a smoothed elevation field using bilinear interpolation across the tile grid
- Use the interpolated field to draw anti-aliased contour lines via marching squares
- Apply per-pixel gradient shading based on interpolated elevation values
- Consider caching the overlay as an `ImageTexture` and only regenerating when elevation changes (performance optimization)

---

### [] Fix Golfer Overlap / Z-Ordering
**Goal:** Prevent golfers from stacking on top of each other and becoming invisible when multiple golfers occupy nearby tiles.

**Current State:** Golfers are rendered as `Node2D` children of the main scene. When multiple golfers stand on the same or adjacent tiles (e.g., waiting on a tee box, putting on a green), they overlap and obscure each other. There's no visual indication of hidden golfers.

**Fixes:**
- **Isometric Y-sort:** Ensure golfers are sorted by their isometric Y position (screen Y + a fraction of screen X) every frame. Godot's `CanvasItem.z_index` or a `YSort`/manual sort on the parent node can handle this. Golfers "in front" (lower on screen) should render on top of golfers "behind" them
- **Positional offset for co-located golfers:** When multiple golfers occupy the same tile (e.g., group waiting on tee), apply small visual offsets so they fan out slightly (like a group standing together). Offset by ~8-12px in screen space per additional golfer
- **Group clustering logic:** On tee boxes and greens, arrange waiting golfers in a semicircle or line formation rather than stacking them all at the tile center
- **Name label stacking:** When golfers are close together, stagger their name/score labels vertically so they don't overlap. Use a simple collision avoidance pass on label positions
- **Active golfer highlighting:** The golfer currently taking a shot should have a subtle highlight ring or always render on top (highest z_index) so the active player is always visible

**Implementation Notes:**
- Add a `_sort_golfers()` method to `GolferManager` called each frame (or when golfer positions change)
- Modify `golfer.gd` to expose a `visual_offset: Vector2` that shifts the sprite without changing the logical grid position
- On tee/green tiles, `GolferManager` assigns offsets to co-located golfers based on group position index

---

### [] Land Purchase & Course Size Progression
**Goal:** Start with a small plot of land and expand by purchasing adjacent parcels. Creates a natural progression curve and meaningful economic decisions.

**Implementation Details:**
- **Starting plot:** New courses begin with a limited buildable area (e.g., 40×40 tiles out of the 128×128 grid). Only tiles within owned land can have terrain placed or modified
- **Land parcels:** Divide the full 128×128 grid into purchasable rectangular parcels (e.g., 16×16 or 20×20 blocks). Display a grid overlay showing parcel boundaries when in a "Buy Land" mode
- **Progressive pricing:** Base land cost starts at $5,000 per parcel. Each subsequent parcel purchased increases the price by 15-25% (simulating market demand / scarcity). Parcels further from the course center cost more (distance premium). Parcels adjacent to water or with elevation variety could cost a premium
- **Visual feedback:** Owned land shown with normal terrain colors. Unowned land shown with a dark tint/hatch overlay. Purchasable parcels (adjacent to owned land) highlighted when in buy mode
- **Purchase UI:** New "Buy Land" button in build mode toolbar. Clicking shows available parcels with prices. Confirm dialog before purchase. Purchased parcels immediately become buildable
- **Boundary enforcement:** Terrain tools, entity placement, and hole creation all check land ownership. Show error message if player tries to build on unowned land
- **Save/load:** Serialize owned parcel list in save data. Migrate old saves to assume all land is owned (backwards compatibility)

**Gameplay Balance:**
- Starting 40×40 plot fits ~3-4 holes comfortably, forcing early decisions about layout
- A full 18-hole championship course requires ~6-8 parcel purchases ($30K-$80K total investment)
- Creates natural spending tension: invest in land expansion vs. buildings vs. course improvements
- Links and Desert themes could have cheaper land; Resort and City more expensive

---

### [] Improved Golfer & Natural Object Sprites
**Goal:** Upgrade the visual quality of golfers, trees, rocks, and other course objects from procedural primitives to more appealing hand-crafted or semi-procedural sprites.

**Current State:**
- Golfers: Procedurally drawn from `Polygon2D` shapes (9 body parts: head, body, arms, legs, shoes, collar, hands, hair, cap). Functional but blocky and toy-like at ~20px tall
- Trees: 3 procedural varieties in `TreeOverlay` (pine=triangle, oak=circle, bushy=wide circle) drawn with basic polygons and flat color fills
- Rocks: Simple grey blobs in `RockOverlay`
- Buildings: Procedurally drawn colored rectangles with minimal detail in `building.gd`

**Recommended Approach — Hybrid (procedural base + hand-drawn detail):**
- **Best practice for isometric 2D pixel art at this scale** is to hand-draw a small sprite sheet of base templates and then programmatically recolor/vary them. This gives much better visual quality than pure procedural generation while still allowing randomization
- **Golfer sprites:** Design a 4-direction sprite sheet (front, back, left, right) at 32×32px or 48×48px per frame. Include animation frames for: idle (2 frames), walk cycle (4-6 frames), swing (4 frames), putt (3 frames). Recolor via shader or palette swap for shirt/pants/cap variety. Tools: Aseprite (pixel art standard), LibreSprite (free), or Piskel (browser-based)
- **Tree sprites:** Hand-draw 4-5 tree varieties per course theme at 48×64px. Each theme needs its own set (palms for Resort, cacti for Desert, pines for Mountain, etc.). Can recolor/scale procedurally for variety
- **Rock sprites:** 3-4 rock formations per theme at 32×32px. Desert gets sandstone, Mountain gets granite, Links gets weathered stone
- **Building sprites:** Redesign as proper isometric sprites at 64×64px or larger. Each building type gets a unique identifiable silhouette
- **Implementation:** Replace `Polygon2D` drawing in `golfer.gd` with `AnimatedSprite2D` loading from sprite sheets. Replace overlay drawing with `Sprite2D` instances placed by the overlay system. This is a significant refactor of the rendering pipeline but greatly improves visual quality

**Alternative — Enhanced Procedural:**
- If hand-drawing is too time-intensive, invest in better procedural generation: add outlines, shading gradients, anti-aliasing, and more detail layers to the existing `Polygon2D` approach. This is cheaper but has a lower visual ceiling
- Could use AI sprite generation tools (Stable Diffusion with pixel art LoRA) to generate base sprites and then clean up manually

**Sprite Asset Pipeline:**
- Store sprites in `assets/sprites/` organized by category: `golfers/`, `trees/`, `rocks/`, `buildings/`
- Use Godot's `SpriteFrames` resource for animated sprites
- Theme-variant sprites stored in subdirectories per theme: `assets/sprites/trees/parkland/`, `assets/sprites/trees/desert/`, etc.

### [] Player-Controlled Golfer Mode
**Goal:** Let the player play their own course as a golfer, adding a "play the course" gameplay loop alongside the management sim. This is a signature SimGolf feature.

**Implementation — Phase 1 (Core Mechanics):**
- **Mode switch:** Add "Play Course" button that switches from management to player-golfer mode. Camera follows the player's golfer. Management UI hides; golf HUD appears
- **Shot interface:**
  - **Club selection:** Horizontal club bar at bottom of screen (Driver, 3-Wood, 5-Iron, 7-Iron, PW, SW, Putter). Click or number keys 1-7 to select
  - **Aim system:** Click-and-drag from ball to set direction. Show projected landing zone circle that accounts for club distance and accuracy. Direction line extends from ball with a cone showing accuracy spread
  - **Power meter:** After setting direction, press-and-hold spacebar for power (0-100%). Release to fire. Alternatively, a classic 3-click swing meter (tap to start, tap for power, tap for accuracy)
  - **Shot shape selector:** Straight, Draw, Fade toggle. Affects trajectory curve and landing offset
- **Shot sectors / zones:** When aiming, display a translucent overlay showing:
  - **Landing zone:** Circle/ellipse where the ball is expected to land based on club + power
  - **Danger zones:** Red tint on water/OB areas within range
  - **Optimal zone:** Green tint on fairway/green areas within range
  - Sector accuracy is affected by player skill (could be upgradable)

**Implementation — Phase 2 (Full Experience):**
- **Putting interface:** Overhead view of green with grid lines showing slope. Drag to set putt direction and power. Show predicted ball path based on slope/break
- **Score tracking:** Full scorecard UI showing hole-by-hole scores, running total, par comparison
- **Wind compensation:** Show wind arrow more prominently, player must manually adjust aim
- **Course flyover:** Before each hole, brief camera pan from tee to green showing layout
- **Player golfer customization:** Choose name, appearance (uses existing golfer color system)
- **AI playing partners:** Option to play alongside 1-3 AI golfers for group feel

**Technical Considerations:**
- Need a new `PlayerGolfer` class or mode flag on existing `Golfer` class that replaces AI decision-making with input handling
- Shot calculation reuses existing physics (`ball.gd` trajectory, terrain modifiers, wind effects) but with player-chosen parameters instead of AI-chosen
- Camera system needs a "follow" mode that tracks the player golfer smoothly
- Game time should pause or slow during player shots (real-time aiming doesn't work if time is running at 4x)
- Management simulation continues in the background (other golfers play, money accumulates) while player is on course

---

### [] Menu & UI Overhaul
**Goal:** Bring the UI up to tycoon-game standards (think Planet Coaster, Two Point Hospital, OpenTTD). The current UI is functional but feels like a debug interface rather than a polished game.

**Current Issues:**
- Top bar is a flat HBox of labels with no visual styling or hierarchy
- Tool palette is a plain list of buttons in a VBox with no grouping or visual separation
- Panels (financial, stats, etc.) use default Godot theme with minimal custom styling
- No main menu / title screen
- No settings/options menu
- Speed controls are small plain buttons
- No visual theme tying the UI together

**Improvements:**

1. **Main Menu / Title Screen:**
   - Game logo and title
   - "New Game" (leads to course type selection), "Load Game", "Settings", "Quit"
   - Animated background showing a procedurally generated course with golfers playing
   - Transition animation into gameplay

2. **Custom UI Theme:**
   - Design a cohesive Godot `Theme` resource with custom styles for: buttons, panels, labels, scrollbars, sliders, separators
   - Color palette: Golf-inspired greens, warm wood-tones for panels, cream/white text
   - Consistent border radius, shadow, and padding across all UI elements
   - Font upgrade: Use a clean sans-serif font (e.g., Nunito, Open Sans) for body text and a display font for headers

3. **Top Bar Redesign:**
   - Segmented bar with distinct sections: Money (with coin icon), Day/Time (with clock icon), Reputation (with star icon), Weather (with condition icon), Wind (with compass)
   - Each section is a clickable panel that opens its detailed view
   - Subtle background with rounded segments and dividers

4. **Toolbar Redesign:**
   - Tabbed categories: Terrain, Landscaping, Buildings, Holes, Utilities
   - Each tab shows a grid of icon buttons (not text lists)
   - Hover tooltip shows name, cost, and description
   - Selected tool highlighted with border glow
   - Collapsible/dockable panel

5. **Improved Speed Controls:**
   - Larger, more visible play/pause/fast/ultra buttons with icons
   - Current speed shown as text label next to controls
   - Keyboard shortcuts displayed on hover (1/2/3/4 or similar)

6. **Notification System Upgrade:**
   - Toast-style notifications that stack in corner and auto-dismiss
   - Color-coded by type (green=revenue, red=cost, blue=info, gold=achievement)
   - Click to expand for detail

7. **Settings Menu:**
   - Graphics: overlay toggle, zoom sensitivity
   - Gameplay: auto-save frequency, notification preferences
   - Audio: volume sliders (when audio is added)
   - Controls: key rebinding

---

### [] Staff & Grounds Maintenance System
**Goal:** Add a staff management layer where the player hires and manages course employees. Staff quality directly affects course condition, pace of play, and golfer satisfaction — a core tycoon mechanic.

**Staff Types:**
- **Groundskeepers:** Maintain terrain quality. Without enough groundskeepers, fairways slowly degrade toward rough, greens get slower (affects putt physics), bunkers become unkempt (reduced visual quality + harder lies). Each groundskeeper maintains ~20-30 tiles. Salary: $50-$150/day depending on skill
- **Course Marshals:** Speed up pace of play. Reduce average round time by nudging slow groups. Without marshals, groups can slow down and reduce daily throughput. Each marshal covers ~4-5 holes. Salary: $40-$80/day
- **Cart Operators:** Required to offer golf cart rentals (additional revenue stream: $15-$30/round). Carts make golfers move faster (2x path speed). Each operator supports ~8 carts. Salary: $30-$60/day
- **Pro Shop Staff:** Required for pro shop to generate revenue. Higher-skilled staff generates more sales. Salary: $40-$100/day

**Implementation:**
- Staff panel in management UI showing all hired staff with names, roles, skill levels, salaries
- Hire/fire with confirmation dialogs
- Staff skill levels (1-5 stars) affect their effectiveness — higher-skilled staff cost more
- Daily payroll added to operating costs (separate line item in financial dashboard)
- Course condition degrades over time based on groundskeeper coverage ratio
- `TerrainGrid` tracks per-tile condition value (0-100%) that groundskeepers restore each day
- Condition affects gameplay: degraded greens have more random putt deviation, degraded fairways give slight rough-like lie penalties

---

### [] Seasonal Calendar & Event System
**Goal:** Add a yearly calendar that cycles through seasons, affecting weather patterns, golfer traffic, maintenance costs, and creating natural revenue fluctuations that the player must plan around.

**Seasons:**
- **Spring (Days 1-90):** Moderate traffic, frequent rain, courses recovering from winter. Maintenance costs +20% (aeration, overseeding). Gradual traffic increase
- **Summer (Days 91-180):** Peak season. Maximum golfer traffic, hot weather, occasional thunderstorms. Premium pricing opportunity. Highest revenue potential
- **Fall (Days 181-270):** Traffic declining gradually, beautiful weather, lower rain. Tournament season bonuses. Leaf cleanup maintenance
- **Winter (Days 271-360):** Low traffic (50-70% reduction depending on course type). Desert/Resort courses less affected. Reduced maintenance costs. Good time for renovations (cheaper building costs)

**Implementation:**
- Add `season` property to `GameManager` derived from `current_day % 360`
- Season affects: weather probability tables, golfer spawn rate multiplier, maintenance cost multiplier, green fee tolerance (golfers accept higher fees in peak season)
- Seasonal visual hints (future enhancement, listed in Post-1.0): grass color shifts, leaf particles in fall, frost overlay in winter
- Calendar UI widget showing current month/season with upcoming events (tournaments, holidays)
- **Holiday events:** Random bonus traffic days (e.g., "Holiday Weekend" = 2x golfers for 2-3 days) with advance notice so player can prepare

---

### [] Marketing & Advertising System
**Goal:** Give players a way to actively attract more golfers rather than passively waiting for reputation to grow. Spending money on marketing is a classic tycoon lever.

**Marketing Channels:**
- **Local Newspaper Ad:** $200/week, +15% local traffic (Beginner/Casual golfers)
- **Golf Magazine Feature:** $1,000/month, +10% Serious/Pro golfers, requires 3+ star rating
- **Social Media Campaign:** $500/week, +20% traffic across all tiers, effect decays after campaign ends
- **Tournament Sponsorship:** $2,000 per event, doubles tournament prize money and reputation gain
- **Loyalty Program:** $100/month flat cost, 10% of golfers become "regulars" who visit 3x as often and have higher satisfaction baseline

**Implementation:**
- Marketing panel accessible from management UI
- Active campaigns shown with duration remaining and estimated effect
- ROI tracking: panel shows cost vs. estimated additional revenue from each campaign
- Campaigns require minimum reputation/rating thresholds
- Diminishing returns: running multiple campaigns of the same type gives reduced bonus

---

## PRIORITY 10.5: World Map & New Game Flow ✅ COMPLETE

### [X] Main Menu & Start New Game Screen
**STATUS: COMPLETE** - The menu offers exactly Start New Game, Quick Start, Continue, Load Game, Settings and Quit. Start New Game collects the company name, difficulty (Easy/Normal/Hard), starting money ($100,000 / $150,000 / $200,000 / Unlimited), the number of generated holes for the first course (0/3/6/9/18) and the Weather/Wind/Seasons features, then hands them to the World Map. Quick Start uses the defaults (random company name, Normal, $100,000, 0 holes, all features) and goes straight there.

### [X] World Map Screen
**STATUS: COMPLETE** - A procedurally drawn orthographic globe carries one marker per destination; the list beside it gives each location's name, theme, size and cost, with Buy (greyed out when unaffordable) or Play per row, and a Reset World button that re-randomises how much land each site starts with — which changes its price. Buy a site to unlock its parcel block, play it, and come back from the pause menu at any time to buy more or switch between owned courses.

### [X] Locations & Land Blocks
**STATUS: COMPLETE** - `WorldLocations` catalogues 27 destinations (Small 9 / Medium 12 / Large 16 / Championship 20 parcels) with themes, globe coordinates and prestige pricing. Every location's land block always contains the central 2×2 cluster, and `layout_order(size, rng, required)` guarantees the 3×3 block an 18-hole first course needs can never be rolled away by Reset World.

### [X] Generated First Course
**STATUS: COMPLETE** - The requested hole count is generated on the site when the player starts playing it: 3, 6 and 9 holes from the existing layouts, 18 holes from `LAYOUT_9` + the new counter-clockwise `LAYOUT_18_BACK` (par 72), plus the starter amenity cluster (clubhouse, coffee house, snack bar, restroom) in the clear pocket beside the first fairway. Company money, reputation, calendar and milestones persist across site switches; each site keeps its own terrain, buildings, staff, holes and land.

## Post-1.0 Ideas

_These are ambitious ideas that would each represent significant scope. Deferred until the core game is complete and polished._

- Career mode with progressive challenges
- Seasonal visual changes (fall foliage, spring flowers)
- Course export/import and sharing

---

## Future Ideas (Deferred from Earlier Priorities)

_These features were considered but deferred to focus on core gameplay. May be revisited later._

### Audio & Animation (from P9)
- Ambient sounds (birds, wind, golf shots)
- Music tracks for different game states
- Animated water tiles
- Animated flag waving

### Additional Content (from P9)
- Bridges over water
- Smooth zoom transitions
- Remember zoom preference between sessions

### UI/UX (from P7)
- Categorized terrain menu with collapsible sections
- Quick-select hotkeys (1-9) for common tools
- Hover tooltips showing terrain cost and maintenance
- First-time player tutorial guidance
- Tooltip hints for UI elements
- Help menu with gameplay tips

### Golfer AI (from P2)
- Prefer walking on cart paths
- More sophisticated A* pathfinding
- Start golfers at clubhouse instead of tee box

### Economy (from P6)
- Golfer needs system (thirst, hunger, fatigue)
- Buildings satisfy specific needs
- Strategic building placement incentives

### Save/Load (from P4)
- Full mid-action golfer state persistence
- Persist ball trajectories mid-flight

## Known Bugs

### Critical
- None currently! All critical bugs have been resolved.

### Fixed (Completed)
- ✅ Clicking plant tree causes the game to crash - Fixed by renaming Tree class to TreeEntity
- ✅ Placing rocks doesn't work - Fully implemented with 3 size options
- ✅ Arrow key camera movement is isometric instead of intuitive - Now moves in visual screen direction
- ✅ Landing zone check was blocking within the same group instead of only other groups
- ✅ Golfer accuracy too low - increased skill range to 0.5-0.9 and reduced error spread
- ✅ Round finish bug - golfers now properly clear the final green
- ✅ Groups deadlocking each other on par 3s - fixed with directional blocking and par 3 holds
- ✅ Ball flight not visible - BallManager failed to create ball on first shot; fixed by adding from_position to ball_landed signal and using get_or_create_ball
- ✅ Golfer/ball tile offset - entities positioned at tile corner instead of center; added grid_to_screen_center helper
- ✅ Infinite putting loop - putts never converged toward hole, blocking next group's tee shots; fixed with gimme range, short putts aim at hole, off-green putts stop at green edge
- ✅ Putter shots flying in arc like wedge shots - putts now roll along the ground with club-aware animation
- ✅ Landing zone deadlock from stuck putters - added putt accuracy floor (95% short, 75% long) and double-par pickup rule
- ✅ Too many groups spawning at once - tightened first tee clear check to also block when golfers are mid-action (walking, preparing, swinging, watching) on hole 0
- ✅ Golfers hitting from green instead of walking to next tee - reset current_strokes after hole-out and added walk-to-tee logic for subsequent holes
- ✅ Walk-to-tee broke first-hole spawning - added first-hole exemption so golfers teleport to tee on hole 1
- ✅ Golfers walking away from hole before heading to green when water/OB blocks path - rewrote pathfinding to try both sides at increasing offsets (3, 5, 8, 12 tiles) with validation
- ✅ Flag icon offset from putting target - flag and hole visualizer used grid_to_screen() (top-left) instead of grid_to_screen_center()
- ✅ Driver max distance unrealistic (450 yards) - reworked to 300 yard max, fairway wood to 255 yard max

### Minor
- (Add bugs as discovered)
